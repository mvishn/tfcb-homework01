### Question 1 ###
Here's a link to my GitHub profile: [https://github.com/mvishn](https://github.com/mvishn)


### Question 2 and 3 ###
Here's a link to my repository:
[https://github.com/mvishn/tfcb-homework01](https://github.com/mvishn/tfcb-homework01)


### Question 4 ###
I created separate folders for each type of file, such as **code**, **data**, and put **images** into a separate folder. 

I also changed the file names to be simpler and removed __spaces__ and most __capital letters__ .


### Question 5 ###
Here's a link to the README file:
[README](https://github.com/mvishn/tfcb-homework01/blob/main/README.md)

##### Image #####
The _images_ folder includes four photogpraphs of differents species of ant. 
Here is the ant with the coolest name - _Rhytidoponera metallica_ - also known as the Green-Head Ant. Rock on!!

##### Lists #####
Here is a list of all the skills I'm trying to demonstrate in this question:
*Making Headings
*Formatting text to be bold or italic
*Making Lists  - List-Ception!!
*Embedding images
*Making a table

Here is a nested list of taxonomic classifications:
1. Kingdom
   - Phylum
     - Class
       - Order
         - Family
           - Genus
             - Species

##### Table #####
| Animalia | Plantae  | Fungi    |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Chordata |Chlorophyta| Zygomycota |
|Arthropoda| Ginkgophyta | Ascomycota  |
| Mollusca | Pinophyta | Basidiomycota  |



### Question 6 ###
Link to the re-formatted data file [here](https://github.com/mvishn/tfcb-homework01/blob/main/data/survey_data.csv).

I don't understand why we saved it as a tab-separated text file only to change it to csv when there's no commas. I'm getting a "warning" in my github when I click on it because there's no commas but it's called csv.

Here's what I did to make the data **tidy**:
* Put everything into one sheet.
* Made a separate column for "plot" instead of having many small tables for different plots.
* Formatted dates to be in the YYYY-MM-DD format.
* Created a "calibration" column where I put **0** if there was a note about the scale not being calibrated, and **1** if no note.
* Put `n/a` where there was missing data.
